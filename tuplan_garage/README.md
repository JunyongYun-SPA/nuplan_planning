## Overview

- The release of nuPlan marks a new era in vehicle motion planning research, offering the first large-scale real-world dataset and evaluation schemes requiring both precise short-term planning and long-horizon ego-forecasting. Existing systems struggle to simultaneously meet both requirements.

- Indeed, we find that these tasks are fundamentally misaligned and should be addressed independently.

- We further assess the current state of closed-loop planning in the field, revealing the limitations of learning-based methods in complex real-world scenarios and the value of simple rule-based priors such as centerline selection through lane graph search algorithms.

- More surprisingly, for the open-loop sub-task, we observe that the best results are achieved when using only this centerline as scene context (i.e., ignoring all information regarding the map and other agents).

- Combining these insights, we propose an extremely simple and efficient planner which outperforms an extensive set of competitors, winning the nuPlan planning challenge 2023.

## Method

> We decompose the process of determining a safe and comfortable trajectory into two sub-tasks: (1) planning the short-term motion, and (2) accurately forecasting the long-term ego trajectory. While the former primarily impacts closed-loop performance, the latter is essential for the open-loop task. Our method employs a rule-based predictive planner to generate a trajectory proposal, and a learned ego-forecasting module that refines the trajectory with a particular emphasis on long-term forecasting.

## To Do
- [ ] Additional baselines
- [ ] Visualization scripts
- [x] Contribution guide
- [x] ML planners code & checkpoints
- [x] Supplementary material, video, slides
- [x] Val14 benchmark
- [x] Installation tutorial
- [x] PDM-Closed release
- [x] Initial repo & main paper


## Getting started

### 1. Installation
To install tuPlan Garage, please follow these steps:
- setup the nuPlan dataset ([described here](https://nuplan-devkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dataset_setup.html)) and install the nuPlan devkit ([see here](https://nuplan-devkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html))
- download tuPlan Garage and move inside the folder
```
git clone https://github.com/autonomousvision/tuplan_garage.git && cd tuplan_garage
```
- make sure the environment you created when installing the nuplan-devkit is activated
```
conda activate nuplan
```
- install the local tuplan_garage as a pip package
```
pip install -e .
```
- add the following environment variable to your `~/.bashrc`
```
NUPLAN_DEVKIT_ROOT="$HOME/nuplan-devkit/"
```

### 2. Training
When running a training, you have to add the `hydra.searchpath` for the `tuplan_garage` correctly.
Note: since hydra does not yet support appending to lists ([see here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra/issues/1547)), you have to add the original searchpaths in the override.
Training scripts can be run with the scripts found in `/scripts/training/`.
Before training from an already existing cache, please check [this](https://github.com/motional/nuplan-devkit/issues/128) issue.
You can find our trained models [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LLdunqyvQQuBuknzmf7KMIJiA2grLYB2?usp=sharing).

### 3. Evaluation
Same as for the training, when running an evaluation, you have to add the `hydra.searchpath` for the `tuplan_garage` correctly.
The example below runs an evaluation of the `pdm_closed_planner` on the `val14_split`, both of which are part of the tuplan_garage
```
python $NUPLAN_DEVKIT_ROOT/nuplan/planning/script/run_simulation.py \
+simulation=closed_loop_nonreactive_agents \
planner=pdm_closed_planner \
scenario_filter=val14_split \
scenario_builder=nuplan \
hydra.searchpath="[pkg://tuplan_garage.planning.script.config.common, pkg://tuplan_garage.planning.script.config.simulation, pkg://nuplan.planning.script.config.common, pkg://nuplan.planning.script.experiments]"
```
You can find exemplary shells scripts in `/scripts/simulation/`
